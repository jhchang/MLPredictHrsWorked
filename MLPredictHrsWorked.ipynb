This data was extracted from the [1994 Census bureau database](http://www.census.gov/en.html) by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker.\n",

        "*   `age`: The age of the individual in years.\n",
        "*   `fnlwgt`: The number of individuals the Census Organizations believes that set of observations represents.\n",
        "*   `education_num`:  An enumeration of the categorical representation of education. The higher the number, the higher the education that individual achieved. For example, an `education_num` of `11` represents `Assoc_voc` (associate degree at a vocational school), an `education_num` of `13` represents `Bachelors`, and an `education_num` of `9` represents `HS-grad` (high school graduate).\n",

        "*   `education`: The highest level of education achieved for that individual.\n",
        "*   `marital_status`: Marital status of the individual. Examples include: `Married-civ-spouse`, `Divorced`, `Never-married`, `Separated`, `Widowed`, `Married-spouse-absent`, and `Married-AF-spouse`.\n",
        "*   `occupation`: The occupation of the individual. Example include: `tech-support`, `Craft-repair`, `Other-service`, `Sales`, `Exec-managerial` and more.\n",
